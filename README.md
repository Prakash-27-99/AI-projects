Vision Transformers (ViTs) are highly effective for object detection, and our constraint-based approach significantly reduces training and validation errors. By applying non-negative constraints, we eliminate negative pixel components, improving convergence and minimizing error rates. This lightweight approach enhances deployment efficiency while managing both time and model complexity. Future work includes exploring various constraint functions, testing on real-world datasets, and conducting comparative studies with other models. We also aim to refine deployment strategies, analyze real-time performance, and develop adaptive procedures for selecting optimal constraints.
